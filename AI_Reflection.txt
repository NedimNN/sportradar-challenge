For implementing this project I have used GitHub Copilot.

The ways in which I have used GitHub Copilot:
    - In generating boilerplate code
    - calendar.jsx:
        - Helping with some of the logic (emphasis on some)
        - Most of the logic in the calendar.jsx was written by me 
        - GitHub Copilot was used for the formatDayLabel and it helped in implementing the modal for mobile devices
        - GitHub Copilot helped with the CSS styling
    - AddEvent.jsx
        - Line 94-124 in the AddEvent.jsx were generated by GitHub Copilot
        - Most of the form elements were generated by GitHub Copilot (I did have to make a lot of changes)
        - GitHub Copilot helped with the CSS styling
    - EventDetails.jsx
        - GitHub Copilot helped with the CSS styling
    - README.md
        - GitHub Copilot helped in writing the README file
